# Contributing Test Scripts

When adding a test script for a specific component or PCB, please ensure the following are included:
    Code: The script itself, well-commented for clarity.
    Short README:
       - A KiCAD schematic of the test circuit.
       - A picture of the assembled test circuit (if possible).
       - Any explanations or details necessary to understand and reproduce the test.

This helps maintain consistency and ensures tests are easy to use and understand by other team members.
